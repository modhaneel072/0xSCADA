/**
 * Control-Loop Stage Timestamps & Per-Stage SLO Instrument (#460)
 *
 * Measures the latency of each stage of the REAL integrity/anchor pipeline that
 * exists on this branch (server/integrity/anchor-pipeline.ts):
 *
 *   batch -> sign -> anchor -> confirm
 *
 *   batch    Merkle root construction over the flushed batch's event hashes
 *            (MerkleTreeBuilder.rootBytes32).
 *   sign     MerkleRootSigner.signMerkleRoot — HSM / software RSA signature.
 *   anchor   AnchorRelayerService.submitAnchor — the hand-off of the signed
 *            root into the relayer's submission queue. NOTE this is the
 *            enqueue only: submitAnchor coalesces the request and kicks
 *            processQueue() WITHOUT awaiting it, so signature verification,
 *            gas estimation and the transaction itself run asynchronously and
 *            land in `confirm`, not here. Measured at ~1ms in practice; the
 *            budget below is sized for a hand-off, so a breach means the event
 *            loop is stalled, not that the chain is slow.
 *   confirm  submit -> the relayer's per-batch `anchorSuccess` event. Covers
 *            signature verification, gas estimation, transaction submission
 *            and the confirmation-block wait.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* MEASURED
 * -----------------------------------
 * The original issue described a `tick` stage (field I/O -> control loop) ahead
 * of `batch`. There is no control loop feeding the anchor pipeline on this
 * branch — BlueprintRuntime (#457) is not wired to it — so there is nothing to
 * time. A `tick` number here could only be invented, so the stage is reported
 * nowhere: not as a metric, not on the dashboard, not in the alert rules. See
 * UNMEASURED_STAGES below; add the stage here (and to the dashboard/rules) once
 * a real control loop exists to measure.
 *
 * Everything in this module is measurement only: every duration is the
 * difference between two timestamps taken around real work. Nothing is
 * synthesised, defaulted, or back-filled.
 *
 * Part of the Dual-Time Control Plane (ADR-0021).
