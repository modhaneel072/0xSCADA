/**
 * Control-Loop Stage Timestamps & Per-Stage SLO Instrument (#460)
 *
 * Pure, dependency-light core for measuring the latency of a control-loop
 * round-trip through the integrity pipeline:
 *
 *   tick -> batch -> sign -> anchor -> confirm
 *
 * Each stage emits two stamped timestamps (enter/exit), except the terminal
 * anchor stage which is bounded by `anchor-enter` and `anchor-confirmed`.
 * From those stamps we derive per-stage durations and a total round-trip,
 * then feed them into Prometheus histograms registered on the shared
 * registry (server/metrics/prometheus.ts).
 *
 * Design goals:
 *  - The trace + measurement logic is a PURE function of the recorded stamps,
 *    so it is unit-testable without Prometheus, the blockchain, or the HSM
 *    present (see __tests__/stage-timestamps.test.ts).
 *  - Wiring into the live anchor pipeline is additive: callers create a
 *    LatencyTrace, call mark(...) at the existing seams, and finally call
 *    observe(...) to publish histograms. No control-relevant code path is
 *    altered.
 *
 * Part of the Dual-Time Control Plane (ADR-0021).
