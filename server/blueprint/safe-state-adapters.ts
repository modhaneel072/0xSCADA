/**
 * Production wiring for the blueprint watchdog / safe-state core (#459).
 *
 * The core ({@link ../safe-state}, {@link ../watchdog}) is deliberately
 * dependency-free and unit-testable. This module adapts the real systems —
 * the canonical anchor backend and the Drizzle audit table — to the minimal
 * interfaces the core consumes.
 *
 * Keeping these adapters separate means the trip logic can be exercised in unit
 * tests with in-memory fakes, while production code composes the real backends.
