/**
 * Blueprint Watchdog (#459)
 *
 * Monitors the wall-clock duration of a blueprint's deterministic control ticks
 * against a per-blueprint budget. When `consecutiveMissesBeforeSafeState`
 * consecutive ticks exceed `tickBudgetMs`, the watchdog *trips*: it halts the
 * blueprint and delegates to {@link SafeStateController} to apply the declared
 * safe state, anchor a CRITICAL `SafeStateEntered` event and audit the
 * transition.
 *
 * The miss counter is reset by any in-budget tick, so transient single-tick
 * overruns (a GC pause, a one-off scheduling hiccup) do not trip the watchdog —
 * only a *sustained* run of over-budget ticks does.
 *
 * This module is pure with respect to time: callers report observed tick
 * durations via {@link Watchdog.observeTick}. That keeps the trip logic fully
 * deterministic and unit-testable without real timers or a live runtime.
 *
 * @see server/blueprint/safe-state.ts
