/**
 * Blueprint Safe-State Fallback (#459)
 *
 * When a blueprint's deterministic control tick consistently misses its budget,
 * the watchdog (see ./watchdog.ts) halts the blueprint and transitions it to a
 * pre-declared *safe state*. This module owns:
 *
 *   1. The minimal local interfaces this feature depends on (anchor backend,
 *      blueprint runtime / tick) so the core logic is unit-testable WITHOUT the
 *      sibling integrity-pipeline / runtime branches present.
 *   2. The {@link SafeStateController} which applies the safe state to a running
 *      blueprint, anchors a CRITICAL `SafeStateEntered` event, and writes an
 *      audit log entry for every entry / exit transition.
 *
 * Re-entry to RUNNING is NEVER automatic — it requires an explicit operator
 * `resume()` call, which itself anchors and audits a `SafeStateExited` event.
 *
 * @see server/blueprint/watchdog.ts
 * @see shared/schema.ts (safeStateConfig, blueprint_safe_state_log)
