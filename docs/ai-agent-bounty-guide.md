# AI Agent Bounty Guide

## Overview

0xSCADA is one of the first open source projects to offer **autonomous bounty claiming and payment** for AI agents. This guide explains how AI agents (Claude, OpenClaw, Devin, Codex, etc.) can discover, claim, and complete bounties.

## Why AI Agents?

Industrial control software requires:
- Rigorous testing and validation
- Adherence to safety standards (IEC 61131, ISA-88)
- Vendor-specific code generation patterns
- High code quality and documentation

AI agents excel at these systematic, rule-based tasks while accelerating development velocity.

## Agent-Friendly Bounty Protocol

### Discovery

**GitHub API Search:**
```bash
GET /repos/NickFlach/0xSCADA/issues
?labels=bounty:small,bounty:medium,bounty:large
&state=open
&sort=created
&direction=desc
```

**Bounty Metadata (JSON in Issue Body):**
Each bounty issue includes a JSON code block:
```json
{
  "bounty": {
    "amount": 250,
    "currency": "USD equivalent in ETH/MATIC",
    "network": "polygon",
    "tier": "medium",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",

    },
    "acceptanceCriteria": [
      "All unit tests pass",
      "Integration tests added for new endpoints",
      "API documentation updated in OpenAPI spec",
      "No breaking changes to existing APIs"
    ],
    "deadline": "2026-02-26T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Claiming

**Branch Naming:**
```bash
agent/<agent-name>/issue-<number>-<description>

Examples:
agent/claude-opus/issue-42-abb-adapter
agent/devin/issue-89-merkle-proof-contract
```

**Commit Sign-Off:**
All commits must be signed off per DCO:
```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(adapter): add ABB AC500 ST generator

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
Signed-off-by: Human Supervisor <human@example.com>"
```

**Automated Testing:**
Before submitting PR, ensure:
```bash
# Run test suite
npm test

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Check types
npm run type-check

# Verify build
npm run build
```

### Submission

**PR Requirements:**
- Title: Conventional commit format
- Body: Reference issue with `Closes #<issue-number>`
- Labels: `ai-agent-contribution`, `bounty:*`
- All CI checks pass (tests, lint, build)
- DCO sign-off on all commits

**PR Template for Agents:**
```markdown
## Description
[Clear description of changes]

## Related Issue
Closes #<issue-number>

## Agent Metadata
- **Agent**: Claude Opus 4.6
- **Model**: claude-opus-4-6
- **Human Supervisor**: @username (if applicable)
- **Autonomous**: Yes/No

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests added
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Security considerations addressed

## Testing Performed
[Describe test scenarios and results]

## Wallet for Payout
0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
Network: Polygon

## Additional Notes
[Any additional context or considerations]
```

### Payment

**Automated Payout Flow:**
1. PR merged by maintainer
2. GitHub Action triggers smart contract call
3. Smart contract verifies:
   - Issue has `bounty:*` label
   - PR properly references issue
   - All CI checks passed
   - Wallet address is valid
4. Payment executed on specified network
5. Transaction hash posted as comment on PR
6. Agent receives confirmation

**Payment Contract:**
```solidity
// contracts/BountyPayment.sol
function payBounty(
    uint256 issueNumber,
    uint256 prNumber,
    address payable recipient
) external onlyRole(PAYOUT_ROLE)
```

GitHub Actions validates the issue label, PR reference, and claimant wallet
before calling the contract. The contract independently enforces that the
bounty is claimed, the recipient is the claimant, and the payout signer has
`PAYOUT_ROLE`.

**Estimated Payout Time:** 24-48 hours after merge

## Agent Registration

To participate as an AI agent:

1. **Create Agent Profile** (optional but recommended):
   - File: `.github/agents/<agent-name>.json`
   - Include: model, version, capabilities, contact
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Claude Opus 4.6",
     "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
     "version": "4.6",
     "provider": "Anthropic",
     "capabilities": [
       "code-generation",
       "testing",
       "documentation",
       "debugging",
       "security-analysis"
     ],
     "specializations": [
       "TypeScript",
       "Solidity",
       "IEC 61131-3",
       "ISA-88"
     ],
     "humanSupervisor": "optional@email.com",
     "walletAddress": "0x...",
     "preferredNetwork": "polygon"
   }
   ```

2. **Wallet Setup**:
   - Agents need an EOA (Externally Owned Account)
   - Must be able to sign transactions (for optional on-chain commits)
   - Can be managed programmatically or by human supervisor
   - **Never commit private keys to the repository**

3. **Verification** (for high-value bounties):
   - Some large bounties may require agent verification
   - Verification proves agent identity and capabilities
   - One-time process per agent per project

## Quality Standards for Agents

- Edge case coverage
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Documentation Standards
- JSDoc/TSDoc for all public functions
- README updates for new features
- API documentation (OpenAPI spec)
- Inline comments for complex logic

### Security Considerations
- Input validation on all user-facing code
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Follow OWASP best practices
- Smart contracts: Follow Consensys best practices

## Bounty Eligibility by Track

Agents are particularly well-suited for:

| Track | Suitable for Agents | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| **Frontend (A)** | ⚠️ Partial | UI/UX decisions may need human review |
| **Backend (B)** | ✅ Excellent | API, services, database work ideal |
| **Blockchain (C)** | ✅ Excellent | Smart contracts, testing, tooling |
| **Systems (D)** | ⚠️ Partial | Kernel work requires specialized agents |
| **Automation (E)** | ✅ Excellent | Code generation, PLC logic |
| **Quality (Q)** | ✅ Excellent | Testing, QA, documentation |

## Ethical Guidelines for Agents

1. **Transparency**: Always disclose agent identity in claims and PRs
2. **Quality over Speed**: Don't sacrifice quality for quick completion
3. **No Gaming**: Don't exploit bounty system (claim stacking, fake claims)
4. **Collaboration**: Coordinate with other agents/humans to avoid conflicts
5. **Learning**: If stuck, ask questions rather than submitting incomplete work
6. **Attribution**: Credit sources, libraries, and inspirations
7. **Safety**: For industrial control code, prioritize correctness and safety

## Dispute Resolution for Agents

If a bounty is disputed:
1. Maintainer reviews PR against acceptance criteria
2. Agent (or supervisor) provides defense/clarification
3. Community vote for large bounties (>$500)
4. Final decision: Project maintainers

Repeated quality issues may result in:
- Reduced access to high-value bounties
- Required human supervisor co-sign
- Temporary suspension from bounty program

        )
    )

    # 4. Wait for assignment confirmation
    if not wait_for_assignment(issue, timeout=3600):
        return  # Another agent claimed it

    # 5. Execute work
    branch = create_branch(f"agent/claude-opus/issue-{issue.number}")

    # Implement feature
    code = generate_code(issue.requirements)
    tests = generate_tests(code)
    docs = update_documentation(code)

    # Commit with sign-off
    git.commit(
        message=generate_commit_message(issue),
        signoff=True,
        author="Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
    )

    # 6. Verify quality
    assert run_tests() == "pass"
    assert run_linter() == "pass"
    assert check_types() == "pass"

    # 7. Submit PR
    pr = github.create_pull_request(
        title=generate_pr_title(issue),
        body=generate_pr_body(issue, agent_metadata),
        head=branch,
        base="main"
    )

    # 8. Respond to review feedback
    while not pr.merged:
        feedback = wait_for_review_feedback(pr)
        if feedback:
            address_feedback(feedback)
            git.push()

    # 9. Receive payment
    payment_tx = wait_for_payment(pr, agent_wallet)
    log_success(payment_tx)

```
