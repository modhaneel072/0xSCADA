# Gitcoin Project Setup Guide

## Overview

This document provides instructions for maintainers on setting up and managing the 0xSCADA Gitcoin bounty program using the Gitcoin Grants Stack and Allo Protocol.

## Prerequisites

- Project multisig wallet (recommended: Gnosis Safe)
- Sufficient funding for bounties (ETH, MATIC, or other supported tokens)
- GitHub maintainer access
- Understanding of smart contract interactions

## Step 1: Project Registration on Gitcoin

### 1.1 Create Gitcoin Account

1. Visit [Gitcoin Grants Stack](https://grants.gitcoin.co/)
2. Connect wallet (use project multisig wallet)
3. Complete project profile:
   - **Project Name**: 0xSCADA
   - **Description**: Decentralized Industrial Control Fabric - Where Atoms Meet Bits
   - **Website**: https://github.com/NickFlach/0xSCADA
   - **Category**: Infrastructure, Web3, Open Source
   - **Tags**: Industrial IoT, SCADA, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Decentralization

### 1.2 Project Verification

Complete verification requirements:
- GitHub repository linked and verified
- Twitter/social media (optional but recommended)
- Project logo and banner (use assets from /branding)
- Team members added with roles

### 1.3 Configure Allo Protocol

The Allo Protocol powers Gitcoin's bounty distribution:

```bash
# Allo Protocol Registry
# Register 0xSCADA as a project profile

Contract: AlloRegistry (varies by network)
Function: createProfile(
  nonce: uint256,
  name: "0xSCADA",
  metadata: {
    protocol: 1,
    pointer: "ipfs://QmBOUNTYMETADATA..."
  },
  owner: <multisig-address>,
  members: [<member-addresses>]
)
```

## Step 2: Wallet Setup

### 2.1 Multisig Wallet (Recommended)

Create a Gnosis Safe multisig for bounty management:

1. Visit [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.global/)
2. Create new Safe:
   - **Signers**: 3-5 core maintainers
   - **Threshold**: 2-of-3 or 3-of-5
   - **Networks**: Polygon (primary), Arbitrum, Optimism

**Example Configuration:**
```
Safe Address: 0x... (to be determined)
Network: Polygon
Signers:
  - Maintainer 1: 0x...
  - Maintainer 2: 0x...
  - Maintainer 3: 0x...
Threshold: 2/3 confirmations required
```

### 2.2 Fund the Wallet

Transfer initial bounty budget:
- **Recommended**: $10,000-50,000 equivalent in MATIC (Polygon)
- **Gas Reserve**: 100-500 MATIC for transaction fees
- **Multi-chain**: Consider funding on Arbitrum/Optimism for diversity

**Funding Breakdown Example:**
```
Network: Polygon
Token: MATIC

Initial Budget:
- Small Bounties ($50-150): $5,000
- Medium Bounties ($150-500): $10,000
- Large Bounties ($500-1500): $8,000
- XL Bounties ($1500+): $5,000
- Gas Reserve: ~500 MATIC
- Emergency Buffer: $2,000

Total: ~$30,000 + gas
```

## Step 3: Smart Contract Deployment

### 3.1 Bounty Payment Contract

Deploy the automated bounty payment contract:

```solidity
// contracts/BountyPayment.sol

// See full implementation in contracts/BountyPayment.sol
// Key functions:
// - registerBounty(issueNumber, amount, criteria)
// - claimBounty(issueNumber, claimant, wallet)
// - payBounty(issueNumber, prNumber, recipient)
// - releaseBounty(issueNumber) // timeout/unclaimed
```

**Deployment Networks:**
- Polygon (primary)
- Arbitrum One
- Optimism
- Base

**Deployment Command:**
```bash
forge build
forge create contracts/BountyPayment.sol:BountyPayment \
  --rpc-url "$BOUNTY_RPC_URL" \
  --private-key "$BOUNTY_PRIVATE_KEY" \
  --broadcast
```

Forge is the canonical contract tool for this repository. Record the
`Deployed to:` address as the `BOUNTY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` repository secret and
verify it with the target network's explorer tooling before enabling payouts.

**Save Deployed Addresses:**
```bash
# .env.bounty-contracts
BOUNTY_CONTRACT_POLYGON=0x...
BOUNTY_CONTRACT_ARBITRUM=0x...
BOUNTY_CONTRACT_OPTIMISM=0x...
BOUNTY_CONTRACT_BASE=0x...
```

### 3.2 Contract Configuration

Configure the bounty contract:

```javascript
// Configure maintainers who can approve payouts
await bountyContract.addMaintainer("0xMAINTAINER1");
await bountyContract.addMaintainer("0xMAINTAINER2");

// Set payment token (MATIC, USDC, etc.)
await bountyContract.setPaymentToken("0xUSDC_ON_POLYGON");

// Configure timeout (14 days default)
await bountyContract.setClaimTimeout(14 * 24 * 60 * 60); // seconds
```

## Step 4: GitHub Integration

### 4.1 GitHub Actions Workflow

Create workflow for automated bounty management:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/bounty-management.yml

name: Bounty Management

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  handle-bounty-claim:
    # Process /claim comments
    # Validate claim format
    # Assign issue to claimer
    # Set timeout

  handle-bounty-payout:
    # Trigger on PR merge
    # Verify PR references bounty issue
    # Call smart contract to pay bounty
    # Post transaction hash as comment
```

### 4.2 Bot Configuration

Set up a GitHub bot or GitHub Actions for:
- Claim validation (`/claim` command)
- Timeout tracking (14-day expiry)
- Payment triggers (on PR merge)
- Status updates

**Required Secrets:**
```bash
# GitHub Repository Secrets
BOUNTY_PRIVATE_KEY        # PAYOUT_ROLE signer
BOUNTY_RPC_URL            # RPC endpoint
BOUNTY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS   # Deployed contract address
BOUNTY_NETWORK            # Human-readable network name for confirmations
```

### 4.3 Label Automation

Configure automatic label management:
- `bounty:claimed` when claimed
- `bounty:in-progress` during work
- `bounty:ready-for-review` when PR submitted
- `bounty:paid` after payment

## Step 5: Bounty Workflow Automation

### 5.1 Claim Processing

When a user comments `/claim`:

1. Parse claim comment for:
   - Timeline
   - Approach (for medium+ bounties)
   - Wallet address
2. Validate:
   - Issue has `bounty:*` label
   - Issue not already claimed
   - Wallet address is valid EVM address
3. Register claim in smart contract:
   ```javascript
   await bountyContract.claimBounty(
     issueNumber,
     claimerGitHubId,
     walletAddress
   );
   ```
4. Assign issue to claimer
5. Add `bounty:claimed` label
6. Set timeout timer (14 days)

### 5.2 Timeout Management

Daily cron job to check for expired claims:

```javascript
// Check for claims older than 14 days without PR
const expiredClaims = await checkExpiredClaims();

for (const claim of expiredClaims) {
  // Release bounty in contract
  await bountyContract.releaseBounty(claim.issueNumber);

  // Remove assignment
  await github.removeAssignment(claim.issueNumber);

  // Remove claimed label
  await github.removeLabel(claim.issueNumber, "bounty:claimed");

  // Comment notification
  await github.createComment(
    claim.issueNumber,
    "This bounty claim has expired (14 days). The bounty is now available for others to claim."
  );
}
```

### 5.3 Payment Processing

When PR is merged:

1. Verify PR references bounty issue
2. Check all acceptance criteria met:
   - All CI checks pass
   - DCO sign-off present
   - Tests pass
   - Code review approved
3. Call smart contract:
   ```javascript
   const tx = await bountyContract.payBounty(
     issueNumber,
     prNumber,
     contributorWallet
   );
   await tx.wait();
   ```
4. Post transaction details:
   ```markdown
   🎉 Bounty paid!

   **Transaction**: https://polygonscan.com/tx/${tx.hash}
   **Recipient**: ${contributorWallet}
   **Amount**: $${bountyAmount}
   **Network**: Polygon

   Thank you for your contribution to 0xSCADA!
   ```
5. Update labels: `bounty:paid`
6. Close issue

## Step 6: Financial Management

### 6.1 Budget Tracking

Maintain a spreadsheet or dashboard:

| Issue | Tier | Amount | Status | Paid Date | TX Hash |
|-------|------|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| #123 | Medium | $250 | Paid | 2026-02-15 | 0x... |
| #124 | Small | $100 | Claimed | - | - |
| #125 | Large | $750 | Open | - | - |

### 6.2 Replenishment

Monitor wallet balance:
- Set alert threshold (e.g., <$5,000 remaining)
- Refill process through multisig
- Announce budget availability to community

### 6.3 Accounting

For tax/accounting purposes:
- Export all transactions monthly
- Tag transactions by category (bounty payments)
- Maintain records of GitHub usernames → wallet addresses
- Track total payouts by contributor

## Step 7: Community Management

### 7.1 Bounty Board

Create a public bounty dashboard:
- Total bounties available
- Total paid to date
- Active bounties
- Top contributors
- Agent vs human contributions

**Example Dashboard:**
```markdown
## 0xSCADA Bounty Board

**Total Bounties Available**: $47,500
**Total Paid to Date**: $12,350
**Active Bounties**: 23
**Completed Bounties**: 87

### Top Contributors (All Time)
1. alice.eth - $3,240 (12 bounties)
2. bob.eth - $2,150 (8 bounties)
3. Claude Opus 4.6 (AI) - $1,890 (11 bounties)
```

### 7.2 Communication Channels

Set up dedicated channels:
- **Discord/Telegram**: `#bounties` channel
- **GitHub Discussions**: "Bounty Program" category
- **Twitter/X**: Regular bounty announcements
- **Newsletter**: Monthly bounty digest

### 7.3 Feedback Loop

Collect feedback quarterly:
- Survey contributors about bounty experience
- Adjust bounty amounts based on market rates
- Refine acceptance criteria based on learnings
- Improve automation based on pain points

## Step 8: Security & Compliance

### 8.1 Security Measures

- **Multisig**: Always use multisig for fund management
- **Audit**: Have bounty contract audited before launch
- **Limits**: Set max bounty payment per transaction
- **Rate Limits**: Prevent spam/abuse of claim system

### 8.2 Legal Compliance

Consult with legal counsel regarding:
- Tax implications of bounty payments
- Contributor status (contractor vs employee)
- International payments
- KYC/AML requirements for large payments

### 8.3 Dispute Resolution

Document clear process:
1. Contributor submits dispute in issue comments
2. Maintainer provides specific feedback within 48 hours
3. Contributor has 7 days to address
4. Community vote for large bounties if needed
5. Final decision by project maintainers
6. Escalation path for serious disputes

## Step 9: Metrics & Analytics

Track key metrics:

### Participation Metrics
- Total bounties claimed
- Claim → completion rate
- Average time to completion
- First-time vs returning contributors

### Quality Metrics
- PR approval rate (first submission)
- Average review cycles
- Test coverage in bounty PRs
- Bug rate in bounty contributions

### Financial Metrics
- Total payouts per month
- Average bounty amount
- Cost per contribution
- ROI on bounty program

### Agent Metrics
- AI agent participation rate
- Agent vs human completion quality
- Agent specializations
- Human + AI collaboration instances

## Step 10: Scaling the Program

As the program grows:

### Tier Adjustments
- Review bounty tier amounts quarterly
- Adjust based on market rates and complexity
- Consider specialized high-value bounties ($5k+)

### Automation Improvements
- Implement AI-powered acceptance criteria checking
- Automatic test coverage validation
- Smart contract-based escrow for large bounties
- Multi-signature requirements for XL bounties

### Partnerships
- Collaborate with other Gitcoin projects
- Cross-project bounties
